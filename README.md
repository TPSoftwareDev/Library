### NuGet Artifacts Repository ###
> Builds of this solution output to an Azure DevOps Artifacts private repository located at https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/tpgroup/_packaging/Teleperformance/nuget/v3/index.json
>
> Access to the Artifacts repo is established on behalf of user **tg-eid-bitbucketAzDevOps** using a personal access token issued from Azure DevOps by the [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider NuGet plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider).
>
> The plug-in is installed into the build container by the **installcredprovider.sh** script located in the root of this repository.  It requires the **VSS_NUGET_EXTERNAL_FEED_ENDPOINTS** and **NUGET_CREDENTIALPROVIDER_SESSIONTOKENCACHE_ENABLED** environmental variables in order to complete authentication with the Artifiacts service.
